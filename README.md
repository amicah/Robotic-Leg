# Robotic-Leg
This code was written in 2019-2020 for my grad school project at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. The code takes input from a gyroscope and sends outputs to dynamixel AX-12A servos in an attempt to maintain the balance of a custom-built robotic leg.

The code was written for Arduino and the servos were controlled with an Arbotix-M robocontroller.
